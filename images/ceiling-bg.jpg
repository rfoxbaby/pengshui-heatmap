# Ceiling Background Placeholder

This is a placeholder file for the ceiling background image of the Sanxingdui Music Hall visual narrative system.

Please replace this with a high-quality background image (1920x1080px minimum) of a starry night sky or celestial scene that will complement the Golden Sun Bird central element.
 
Recommended image: A deep space or night sky image with subtle golden stars or a nebula, intended to be used with low opacity to create a celestial, mystical backdrop for the ceiling section.
