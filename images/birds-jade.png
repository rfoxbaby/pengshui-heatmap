# Birds and Jade Artifacts Placeholder

This is a placeholder file for the birds and jade artifacts image used in the ceiling section of the Sanxingdui Music Hall visual narrative system.

Please replace this with a high-quality PNG image with transparent background featuring bird motifs and jade artifacts from the Sanxingdui and Jinsha sites. This image will be used as one of the surrounding elements of the Golden Sun Bird in the ceiling section.
 
Recommended: A composition of bird-shaped bronze ornaments and jade cong (玉琮) or other jade artifacts, arranged in a way that suggests flight or movement, with a transparent background for visual integration with other elements.
