# Artifact 6: Golden Sun Bird Placeholder

This is a placeholder file for the Golden Sun Bird (金沙太阳神鸟) from the Jinsha site.

This exquisite gold foil artifact, dating back to around 1000 BCE, is a ring-shaped piece measuring 12.5 cm in diameter. It features four birds flying in a counterclockwise direction around a 12-pointed sun pattern in the center. The Golden Sun Bird has been adopted as the official logo for Chinese Cultural Heritage and symbolizes the ancient Shu people's worship of the sun and birds.
