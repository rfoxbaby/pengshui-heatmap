# Bronze Masks Placeholder

This is a placeholder file for the bronze masks image used in the ceiling section of the Sanxingdui Music Hall visual narrative system.

Please replace this with a high-quality PNG image with transparent background of the distinctive bronze masks from Sanxingdui. This image will be used as one of the surrounding elements of the Golden Sun Bird in the ceiling section.
 
Recommended: A cutout composition of several bronze masks with varied expressions, arranged artistically to create visual interest while maintaining the cultural integrity of the artifacts.
